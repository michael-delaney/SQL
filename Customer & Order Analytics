AND Product = 'iPhone';

--3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT Product, MIN(price) FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price
LIMIT 1;

--5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)*price as Revenue FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY Revenue;

--6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(c.acctnum), AVG(quantity * price) FROM customers AS c
JOIN FebSales as F
ON c.order_id = f.orderID
WHERE f.quantity > 2
AND length(f.orderid) = 6;

--8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'

HAVING count(orderID) > 2;

--10. How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

--12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? 
SELECT SUM(f.quantity) / COUNT(c.acctnum) AS AVG_Qt_Acct
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS c
