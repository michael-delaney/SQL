--I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data
--Used with SQLite

--1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6;

--2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND Product = 'iPhone';

--3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT c.acctnum FROM customers AS c
JOIN FebSales AS f
ON c.order_id = f.orderID
WHERE length(c.order_id) = 6
GROUP BY c.acctnum;

--4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT Product, MIN(price) FROM JanSales
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price
LIMIT 1;

--5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT Product, SUM(quantity)*price as Revenue FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY Revenue;

--6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, Quantity, (Quantity * price) AS Revenue FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';

--7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(c.acctnum), AVG(quantity * price) FROM customers AS c
JOIN FebSales as F
ON c.order_id = f.orderID
WHERE f.quantity > 2
AND length(f.orderid) = 6;
